# Syseqsolve

This program solve the system of equations given:

1. There should be as many equations as the vairables
2. The solutios are always appriximations and not the exact values


There are some functions in the program to manipulate the matrix such as



# det(matrix) 
*calculate the determinant

# remove_col(matrix, row, col)
*which remove the given row and column

# adjoint(matrix)
*which calculates the adjoint of the matrix

# inverse(matrix)
*which calculates the inverted matrix

# transpose(matrix)
*which returns the tanspose of matrix




## To extract the matrix out of equations:

# read_eq(equation)


# solve(matrix, rounding) is used to solve the equations

# NOTE: if the determinant of matrix of variables is 0 then it will return an error even if there is a solution to it

example : 2x + 4y = 6, x + 2y = 3
